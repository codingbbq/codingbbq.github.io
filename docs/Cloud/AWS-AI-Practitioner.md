### Q59. A healthcare company is developing a machine learning model to predict patient outcomes based on medical data. 

To ensure the model generalizes well, the company needs to understand the balance between underfitting and overfitting and how to address these issues. Which of the following would you identify as correct regarding underfitting and overfitting in machine learning?

- Underfit models experience high bias, whereas, overfit models experience low variance
- Underfit models experience low bias, whereas, overfit models experience high variance
- Underfit models experience high bias, whereas, overfit models experience high variance
- Underfit models experience low bias, whereas, overfit models experience low variance

**Underfit models experience high bias, whereas, overfit models experience high variance**

(Your model is underfitting the training data when the model performs poorly on the training data. This is because the model is unable to capture the relationship between the input examples (often called X) and the target values (often called Y). Your model is overfitting your training data when you see that the model performs well on the training data but does not perform well on the evaluation data. This is because the model is memorizing the data it has seen and is unable to generalize to unseen examples.

Underfit models experience high bias — they give inaccurate results for both the training data and test set. On the other hand, overfit models experience high variance - they give accurate results for the training set but not for the test set. More model training results in less bias but variance can increase. Data scientists aim to find the sweet spot between underfitting and overfitting when fitting a model. A well-fitted model can quickly establish the dominant trend for seen and unseen data sets.)
