# What are Foundation Models?

<div className="text--center"> <img src="/img/foundation-model.png" alt="Foundation Models overview" width="600" /> </div>
    
A Foundation Model is a very large AI model that has been trained on massive amounts of data so it can understand and generate things like language, text, and even images. These models are not built for just one task — they can be adapted to many different ones. 

Instead of training an AI separately for:
- chat
- writing
- summarizing
- answering questions

you first train one big model on huge amounts of data so it learns:
- language patterns
- meaning
- context
- reasoning

That trained model becomes the foundation.

Because of this, Foundation Models are useful across a wide variety of applications.
- writing and summarizing text
- answering questions
- generating images
- translating languages
- building chatbots
 …and much more.

To conclude: 
💡 What makes Foundation Models special?

 Unlike traditional models that are built for one purpose, foundation models:
- are trained on broad, diverse data
- can handle many tasks with minimal extra training
- serve as reusable starting points for custom AI solutions
- help developers build AI applications faster and more cost-effectively. 

✨ Foundation models are the powerful, flexible base that’s driving the next generation of AI applications.
