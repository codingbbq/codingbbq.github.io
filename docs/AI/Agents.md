# What are AI Agents?

<div className="text--center"> <img src="/img/Agent.png" alt="Agents overview" width="600" /> </div>

Most AI models just answer questions.
AI agents, on the other hand, think, act, observe, and improve.

Think of an AI agent like a smart assistant doing a task step by step

1. Think – “What should I do first?”
2. Act – Uses a tool, runs a search, writes code, etc.
3. Observe – Checks what happened
4. Reflect – “Did this work? What went wrong?”
5. Try again – Improves the next step

This loop continues until the task is done.

📋 You’ll often see agents reason like this:

Thought: I need more information
Action: Search the database
Observation: Found relevant data
Thought: Now I can answer

⚡This pattern is called ReAct (Reason + Act).


🪞 Reflection makes agents smarter
Agents don’t just act—they review their mistakes.
If something fails, the agent reflects on why and adjusts its plan, similar to how humans learn from errors.


🧰 Tools matter
Agents become powerful because they can use tools:

🔍 Search the web or an internal knowledge base
🗄️ Query a database
📄 Read or write files
🧮 Run calculations or code
📡 Call APIs (GitHub, Slack, CRM, cloud services)

But more tools aren’t always better—too many tools can confuse the agent, just like humans.

💡 In simple terms:
An AI agent is not just answering questions—it’s planning, using tools, learning from feedback, and adapting.

That’s what makes agents useful for real-world, multi-step tasks.
