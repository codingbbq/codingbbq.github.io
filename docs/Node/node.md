## Definition of Middleware

Middleware in Node.js, particularly in the context of Express.js, refers to functions that execute during the request-response cycle. These functions have access to the **request** (req) and **response** (res) objects, as well as a **next()** function that allows them to pass control to the next middleware in the stack. Essentially, middleware serves as an intermediary layer that can process requests before they reach the final route handler.

### Common Use Cases of Middleware

Middleware can be utilized for a variety of purposes, including but not limited to:

1. **Authentication and Authorization**: Middleware can check if a user is authenticated before granting access to certain routes. For example, an authentication middleware might verify tokens in headers or cookies.

2. **Logging**: Middleware can log incoming requests for monitoring and debugging purposes. This is often implemented using a logging library like Morgan.

3. **Body Parsing**: Middleware such as `body-parser` is used to parse incoming request bodies in various formats (e.g., JSON, URL-encoded) so that they can be easily accessed in route handlers.

4. **Error Handling**: Error-handling middleware can catch errors that occur during request processing and send appropriate responses back to the client.

5. **CORS Handling**: Middleware can manage Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) settings to control which domains are permitted to access resources on your server.

6. **Rate Limiting**: Middleware can limit the number of requests a client can make to prevent abuse or overload on the server.

7. **Static File Serving**: Middleware can serve static files from a directory, allowing for easy access to assets like images and stylesheets.

### Types of Middleware

There are several types of middleware in Node.js:

- **Application-Level Middleware**: Defined at the application level using `app.use()`, it applies to all routes or specific routes.
- **Router-Level Middleware**: Similar to application-level but scoped to a specific router instance.
- **Built-in Middleware**: Provided by Express itself, such as `express.json()` for parsing JSON bodies.
- **Third-Party Middleware**: External libraries that add additional functionality (e.g., `cors`, `helmet`).
- **Error-Handling Middleware**: Specifically designed to handle errors that occur during request processing.

### Example of Custom Middleware

```javascript
app.use((req, res, next) => {
    console.log(`Request URL: ${req.url}`);
    next(); // Pass control to the next middleware
});
```

This middleware logs the URL of each incoming request before passing control to the next function in the stack.
