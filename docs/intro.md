# Intro
Throughout my career in the tech industry, I have had the privilege of working on a wide range of projects, from small web shops to large-scale enterprise applications. This diverse experience has provided me with valuable insights and learnings that I would like to share.

## Journey

Collaborating with talented individuals in the fields of UX, backend development, and front-end work has been instrumental in my professional growth. I have been fortunate to work with like-minded individuals who share my passion for delivering high-quality solutions.

The opportunity to pursue work that aligns with my interests and values has been incredibly fulfilling. It has allowed me to contribute to projects that I truly care about and derive great satisfaction from.

I am excited to continue my journey in the tech industry, constantly learning and evolving as a professional.

Started my career in 2008-2009 with PHP as my main programming language, where I built and configured WordPress websites. As time went on, I transitioned into front-end development, and during that period, jQuery was a popular tool.

I expanded my knowledge by learning AngularJS, and now I have extensive experience with the Angular framework. I also enjoy staying up-to-date with new libraries and frameworks, and I have continued to explore and use Angular, React, and now Next.js.

In addition to front-end development, I have also written utilities using Node.js to automate repetitive tasks such as web crawlers and build processes.

## What to expect?

In addition to my blog, where I intend to write detailed blog posts sharing my thoughts on everything related to software development, this section will be dedicated to writing very **specific technical content that are basically my learnings** which can be used as a reference for front-end interviews.
