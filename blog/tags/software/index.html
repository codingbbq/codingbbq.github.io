PR#458 wasn&#x27;t just another contribution but a significant milestone in my journey as a software developer. It was a challenging task that pushed me to my limits, and in overcoming those challenges, I learned valuable lessons that have shaped my approach to coding.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="by-the-numbers">By the Numbers<a href="#by-the-numbers" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to By the Numbers" title="Direct link to By the Numbers">​</a></h2><p>Before we delve into the story, let&#x27;s take a moment to appreciate the sheer scale of this Pull Request. It comprised nearly 10 individual commits, introduced close to 2,800 new lines of code, and astonishingly, resulted in the deletion or modification of over 314,400 lines across almost 1,000 files.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="history">History<a href="#history" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to History" title="Direct link to History">​</a></h2><p>The project I worked on has a rich history spanning almost two decades, evolving from a Windows application to a browser-based web app with a diverse tech stack.
This enterprise application has made careers of many software engineers, which means this codebase had been touched by many software engineers.
With wide tech stack such as CPP, Java and Dojo framework on the UI, over the years, it accumulated tech debt, and my role primarily focused on UI enhancements and refactoring.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-need-for-a-change">The need for a change<a href="#the-need-for-a-change" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The need for a change" title="Direct link to The need for a change">​</a></h2><p>The accumulation of tech debt prompted a thorough review of the codebase to identify areas for improvement:</p><ul><li>Removal of unused assets and code snippets.</li><li>Refactoring of legacy code to improve readability and maintainability.</li><li>Elimination of support for outdated browsers.</li><li>Streamlining of build scripts to remove unnecessary generated files.</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="motivational-quotes">Motivational Quotes<a href="#motivational-quotes" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Motivational Quotes" title="Direct link to Motivational Quotes">​</a></h2><p>I came across a tweet from Elon Musk that resonated deeply with me: &quot;Far better to delete code than add it.&quot; This philosophy encapsulates the essence of efficient software development. While striving for 100% optimized and performant code from day one may seem ideal, the reality is that codebases evolve over time, accumulating unnecessary complexities and redundancies.</p><p>Another quote I hold dear is, &quot;Always leave the code better than you found it,&quot; attributed to Ward Cunningham. This mindset drove me to embark on a journey of code refactoring and deletion, particularly in a legacy codebase spanning two decades.</p><p>Given that we were at the onset of a new release cycle, it presented the perfect opportunity to implement these changes.
In the process, I identified several areas ripe for improvement:</p><ul><li>Eliminating unused styles and assets meticulously, even if they were part of the codebase for years.</li><li>Letting go of support for outdated browsers, such as IE6, as their usage dwindled over time.</li><li>Since our project utilized the Dojo framework, it came with its own set of theme files. I painstakingly sifted through these files, pinpointing and eliminating any redundant styles that were no longer in use.</li><li>Streamlining build scripts to remove unnecessary auto-generated files, optimizing the build process.</li></ul><p>These actions required patience and thorough unit testing at every stage to ensure they didn&#x27;t impact existing functionality adversely. By adhering to these principles and embracing the challenge of improving legacy code, I not only enhanced the codebase&#x27;s quality but also cultivated a mindset of continuous improvement in software development.</p><p>We diligently conducted unit tests at every stage to ensure that our changes didn&#x27;t inadvertently impact any existing functionality.</p><p>In the end, this comprehensive cleanup effort not only improved the overall quality of our codebase but also positioned us for smoother development cycles in the future.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-result">The Result<a href="#the-result" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Result" title="Direct link to The Result">​</a></h2><p>The PR was not only about code changes but also about personal growth:</p><ul><li>Increased confidence in tackling a codebase spanning two decades.</li><li>Improved code readability and maintainability.</li><li>Timely refactoring to prevent future tech debt.</li><li>Opened doors for new opportunities and stretch assignments.</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="room-for-improvement">Room for improvement<a href="#room-for-improvement" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Room for improvement" title="Direct link to Room for improvement">​</a></h2><p>While I&#x27;m incredibly proud of this PR, reflecting on it, there are areas where I could have refined my approach:</p><ul><li><p><em>Learning Opportunity:</em> This PR provided me with a valuable opportunity to delve deep into the codebase, uncovering insights and learning valuable lessons along the way. It&#x27;s crucial to leverage such opportunities for continuous growth and improvement.</p></li><li><p><em>Confidence Boost:</em> Deleting code can be daunting, especially when it seems to be functioning correctly. However, this experience reinforced my confidence in making impactful changes to enhance the codebase&#x27;s quality and performance.</p></li><li><p><em>Enhanced Readability and Maintainability:</em> By eliminating unused code and improving overall code cleanliness, we not only optimized performance but also made future development efforts more efficient. Why burden ourselves with code that serves no purpose? Additionally, utilizing version control tools like Git and GitHub ensures that we can always reference previous versions if needed.</p></li><li><p><em>Doors to New Opportunities:</em> Although this PR focused on code cleanup rather than adding new features, it opened doors to exciting opportunities. It demonstrated my commitment to maintaining code quality and readiness to tackle tech debt, qualities that are highly valued in any development team.</p></li></ul><p>In hindsight, I could have further optimized my approach:</p><ul><li>Breaking down the tasks into smaller, more focused PRs could have facilitated smoother integration and minimized the risk of unintended side effects. This iterative approach would have allowed for more granular testing and validation over multiple production builds, ensuring a seamless transition.</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Conclusion" title="Direct link to Conclusion">​</a></h2><p>In conclusion, working on PR#458 was an enriching experience:</p><ul><li>Deepened my understanding of the codebase.</li><li>Boosted my confidence in refactoring and deletion.</li><li>Enhanced the overall quality of the codebase.</li><li>Presented new opportunities for professional growth and learning.</li><li>Overall, PR#458 represents not just a code contribution but a journey of growth, learning, and improvement.</li></ul></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/personal">personal</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/software">software</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/experience">experience</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/working-with-legacy-code">5 Reasons to enjoy working on Legacy code</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2022-11-19T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">November 19, 2022</time> · <!-- -->3 min read</div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Working on legacy code has its own advantages and in this post I want to talk about how I enjoy and appreciate working on code that is dated as old as 15+ years.</p><p>You do not always get to start a project from scratch.
