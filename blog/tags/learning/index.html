<p>A Large Language Model (LLM) is an AI model designed to understand and generate human-like text based on vast amounts of data. It uses advanced algorithms to process and respond to language, enabling tasks like text generation, translation and question-answering</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Diffusion Models start with noise or random data, and gradually add information until a recognizable pattern is obtained. This is often applied to image generation but can also be used for text or audio genreation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Multimodal models are foundation models which have been trained on multiple media types. These media types can include text, audio, video, and images. The models can both interpret and generate these media types.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Generative Adversarial Networkds (GANs) - This model consists of two neural networks which compete with each other. One generates content, and the other attempts to differentiate that generated content from real data. the competition continues until the generated content and real data are indistinguishable from each other.</p>

<li>
<p>Simplicity - Generative AI models often simplify complex workflows by automating content generation and decision-making processes. They reduce the need for manual intervention or domain-specific coding, making AI-driven solutions more accessible to non-technical users. As a result, businesses can deploy sophisticated solutions with minimal setup and oversight.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creativity and Exploration - Generative AI opens up new avenues for creativity by suggesting novel ideas, designs, or content based on learned patterns. It can assist with brainstorming, creative writing, and design prototyping, providing users with unexpected and innovative options. This capability helps push the boundaries of traditional problem-solving and artistic creation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data Efficiency - Many generative AI models are designed to learn effectively from relatively small datasets through pre-training and fine-tuning techniques. This data efficiency reduces the dependency on massive labeled datasets, lowering costs and effort associated with data preparation. It also allows models to generate meaningful outputs even in data-sparse environments.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="generative-ai-disadvantages">Generative AI DisAdvantages<a href="#generative-ai-disadvantages" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Generative AI DisAdvantages" title="Direct link to Generative AI DisAdvantages">​</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Regulatory Violations - Generative AI models can inadvertently generate content that violets regulatory guidelines, such as producing misleading financial advice or content that doesn&#x27;t comply with advertising standards. Organizations using these models may face complaince challenges, especially in highly regulated industries like healthcare and finance. this risk underscores the need for strict oversight and adherence to legal requirements when deploying AI systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Social Risks - Generative AI can be used to create deepfakes disinformation, or biased content, potentially amplifying harmful social impacts. Such outputs can erode trust, manipulate public opinion, or contribute to social polarization. The misuse of generative AI for malicious purpose poses significant ethical and societtal concerns that require careful mitigation strategies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data Security and Privacy Concerns - Generative AI models often require access to sensitive datasets, raising risks of data leakage or unintended exposure of personal information. If improperly handled, these models may inadvertently reveal private data points from training data. Ensuring data security and maintaining user privacy is a critical challenge when deploying generative models, especially in sensitive applications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Toxicity - Generative models can sometimes produce toxic or harmful content, such as offensive language or inappropriate suggestions, if they are not carefully monitored. This issue is often due to biases or toxic patterns present in the training data. It necessitates rigorous content moderation and filtering techniques to prevent harmful outputs in public-facing applications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hallucinations - Generative AI may produce outputs that are factually incorrect or completely fabricated, known as &quot;hallucinations&quot;. This problem is particularly challenging when using AI for tasks requiring high accuracy, such as generating technical documentation or answering factual questions. Hallucinations can undermine trust and reliability, making it difficult to use generative AI in mission-critical scenarios.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nondeterminism - Generative AI models can produce different outputs even when given the same input, due to their probabilistic nature. This nondeterminism complicates tasks that require consistency, such as legal document generation or standardized communication. It also makes debugging and validating AI-generated outputs more complex, limiting their applicability in certain use cases.</p>

After having discovered Canva in 2022, I started taking insipiration from various designs in Canva and Pinterest and created simple graphics for Watsapp Status and Instagram. Having this on hands experience, it helped me understand how to make something attractive and eye catching within a limited space and with limited use of words.</p>
<p>I enjoy spending hours on canva, but at the same time, I have gained creative and valuable skills while doing it on hands.</p>
<p>I came across this course from Robin Williams about principles of Great design and it surely benefited me from my existing knowledge. The course is well structured and here are some of the important points taken from the course.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-principle-of-proximity">The principle of Proximity<a href="#the-principle-of-proximity" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The principle of Proximity" title="Direct link to The principle of Proximity">​</a></h2>
<p>Group related items together. Physical closeness implies a relationship.
Proximity does not mean that everything is close together - it means elements that are intellectually connected should be visually connected.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-principle-of-alignment">The principle of Alignment<a href="#the-principle-of-alignment" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The principle of Alignment" title="Direct link to The principle of Alignment">​</a></h2>
<p>Nothing should be placed on the page arbitrarily. Even item should have a visual connection with something else on the page.</p>
<ul>
<li>In life as well as in Design, alignment has a purpose.</li>
<li>Clean alignment can improve the communication of any piece of work. It presents a more professional appearance.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-principle-of-repetition">The principle of Repetition<a href="#the-principle-of-repetition" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The principle of Repetition" title="Direct link to The principle of Repetition">​</a></h2>
<p>Repeat some element of the design throughout the entire piece. This is a critical unifying factor.</p>
<ul>
<li>You already create consistency in your design work. Take elements of that consistency and push it - emphasize the consistency so it becomes a repetitive and unifying element of design.</li>
<li>Repetition helps to clarify information and provide structure.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-principle-of-contrast">The principle of Contrast<a href="#the-principle-of-contrast" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The principle of Contrast" title="Direct link to The principle of Contrast">​</a></h2>
<p>Contrast is what draws a reader&#x27;s eye to the page in the first place. Contrast also provides clarity of information.</p>
<ul>
<li>One effect of contrast is that it pulls the reader&#x27;s eye into the information, and one result is clearer communication.</li>
<li>Use contrast to clarify information as well as make the page more attractive.</li>

<p>I have no clue what made me register on the meetup.com website. It was Friday evening, I was about to wrap up my daily office work. I pointed my browser to meetup.com and registered. The website popped at me a meetup that was happening on Saturday 05th of Oct 2019 from 10.00 AM to 12.00 PM. The host were sharing their experience about <b>React with Typescript == React on Steroids</b>. Interesting. I wanted to learn about it. Unfortunately, RSVP were closed. &quot;I could always watch about such topic on YouTube&quot;, I thought.</p>
