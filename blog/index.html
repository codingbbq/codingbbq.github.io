After having discovered Canva in 2022, I started taking insipiration from various designs in Canva and Pinterest and created simple graphics for Watsapp Status and Instagram. Having this on hands experience, it helped me understand how to make something attractive and eye catching within a limited space and with limited use of words.</p>
<p>I enjoy spending hours on canva, but at the same time, I have gained creative and valuable skills while doing it on hands.</p>
<p>I came across this course from Robin Williams about principles of Great design and it surely benefited me from my existing knowledge. The course is well structured and here are some of the important points taken from the course.</p>

<p>Group related items together. Physical closeness implies a relationship.
Proximity does not mean that everything is close together - it means elements that are intellectually connected should be visually connected.</p>

<p>Nothing should be placed on the page arbitrarily. Even item should have a visual connection with something else on the page.</p>
<ul>
<li>In life as well as in Design, alignment has a purpose.</li>
<li>Clean alignment can improve the communication of any piece of work. It presents a more professional appearance.</li>

<p>Repeat some element of the design throughout the entire piece. This is a critical unifying factor.</p>
<ul>
<li>You already create consistency in your design work. Take elements of that consistency and push it - emphasize the consistency so it becomes a repetitive and unifying element of design.</li>
<li>Repetition helps to clarify information and provide structure.</li>

<p>According to MDN, a polyfill is a code snippet, typically JavaScript on the web, that provides modern functionality on older browsers lacking native support. For instance, if you want to use the latest JavaScript APIs like array <code>filter</code> or <code>map</code>â€”supported by Chrome but not IE7â€”you&#x27;d need a polyfill to ensure seamless functionality.</p>

<p>A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a system of interconnected servers that accelerate webpage loading for data-heavy applications. Commonly used static assets like jQuery, AngularJS, React, and Bootstrap.css reside on CDNs. Web applications can directly use these assets, saving on network and storage costs while enhancing application performance.</p>
<p>When a user in Location X visits your web application, the static files needed are downloaded from the nearest CDN to Location X, reducing latency and improving performance.</p>

<p>AngularJS was very popular library and talk of the town.</p>
<p>The Software product had a requirement of providing a search solution with display of tabular data / pagination etc. with some UI animation.</p>
<p>It was decided by the tech lead and the management to go with AngularJS and there could be various reasons for it, possibly:</p>
<ul>
<li>AngularJS was popular framework</li>
<li>Going forward all the new features in this software product had to be developed using AngularJS</li>
<li>It is always exciting to work on a new technology irrespective of figuring out if it actually is needed.</li>
</ul>
<p>This feature was released and praised, but over the years, there have been no instances of this library being used for any other features, reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Continued usage of the legacy framework, it being the obvious choice</li>
<li>The rising popularity of Angular2 over AngularJS causing lack of time and interest.</li>
<li>Lack of resources / technical skills in AngularJS</li>
</ul>
<p>So, this huge product had AngularJS as a low hanging fruit, used only for one single feature.</p>
<p>However, security fixes to AngularJS library were patched whenever available.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="transition-from-angularjs-to-vanilla-javascript">Transition from AngularJS to Vanilla JavaScript<a href="#transition-from-angularjs-to-vanilla-javascript" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Transition from AngularJS to Vanilla JavaScript" title="Direct link to Transition from AngularJS to Vanilla JavaScript">â€‹</a></h3>
<p>Fast forward to today, and our feature remains, but the landscape has shifted.  AngularJS is officially deprecated and so we had to reevaluate our choice.</p>
<ul>
<li>AngularJS library is deprecated.</li>
<li>Security concerns from customers</li>
<li>In this entire product, AngularJS is just used for this one feature.</li>
</ul>
<p>We chose to use Vanilla JavaScript for various reasons, though the specifics are not relevant here.</p>
<p>When I began working on this feature, it became clear that Vanilla JavaScript could effortlessly provide the same functionality.</p>

<p>After careful evaluation of the code, it appeared that this feature was over-engineered.</p>
<ul>
<li>I discovered unused or infrequently used library files, bootstrap files, and a templating engine library.</li>
<li>I believe these libraries were added with the assumption that they would be useful for developing new features in the future. However, this turned out not to be the case.</li>
<li>Naturally, no one wanted to work with this code again, so all the core library files were left untouched.</li>
<li>There were clear violations of the DRY (Don&#x27;t Repeat Yourself) and KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) design principles, indicating areas for improvement.</li>
</ul>

<p>Opting for vanilla JavaScript, we embarked on a journey to streamline our codebase and embrace the principles of DRY (Don&#x27;t Repeat Yourself), KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid), and YAGNI (You Ain&#x27;t Gonna Need It).</p>
<p>The entire exercise of removing AngularJs involved the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reviewing and understanding the entire feature</li>
<li>Reading the AngularJS code and identifying areas for improvement</li>
<li>Rewriting the entire feature using vanilla JavaScript</li>
<li>Ensuring the transformation does not affect the user, as only the underlying technology is being changed, not the user experience.</li>
</ul>

<p>What began as an experiment turned into a revelation. With over 16K lines of unnecessary clutter stripped away, and under 1K lines of focused, purposeful addition, we emerged with a leaner, more efficient feature.</p>

<p>The journey wasn&#x27;t without its challenges, but it was immensely rewarding. We honed our skills, boosted our confidence, and left behind a codebase that is not just functional, but elegant and maintainable.</p>
<ul>
<li>Increased my confidence in working independently on a feature.</li>
<li>Enhanced my ability to read any framework code and convert it to vanilla JavaScript.</li>
<li>Deepened my understanding of vanilla JavaScript.</li>
<li>Refactored the code, making it more readable and maintainable.</li>
</ul>
<p>As we continue to evolve, let&#x27;s remember the value of simplicity, the power of pragmatism, and the importance of continuous improvement.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/personal">personal</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/software">software</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/experience">experience</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy"><a href="/blog/proudest-pr-yet">PR#458 - My Prodest PR yet!!!</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2024-04-15T00:00:00.000Z">April 15, 2024</time> Â· <!-- -->5 min read</div></header><div class="markdown"><p>In this blog post, I am thrilled to share the story behind my proudest Pull Request (PR) yet. PR#458 wasn&#x27;t just another contribution but a significant milestone in my journey as a software developer. It was a challenging task that pushed me to my limits, and in overcoming those challenges, I learned valuable lessons that have shaped my approach to coding.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="by-the-numbers">By the Numbers<a href="#by-the-numbers" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to By the Numbers" title="Direct link to By the Numbers">â€‹</a></h2>
<p>Before we delve into the story, let&#x27;s take a moment to appreciate the sheer scale of this Pull Request. It comprised nearly 10 individual commits, introduced close to 2,800 new lines of code, and astonishingly, resulted in the deletion or modification of over 314,400 lines across almost 1,000 files.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="history">History<a href="#history" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to History" title="Direct link to History">â€‹</a></h2>
<p>The project I worked on has a rich history spanning almost two decades, evolving from a Windows application to a browser-based web app with a diverse tech stack.
This enterprise application has made careers of many software engineers, which means this codebase had been touched by many software engineers.
With wide tech stack such as CPP, Java and Dojo framework on the UI, over the years, it accumulated tech debt, and my role primarily focused on UI enhancements and refactoring.</p>

<p>The accumulation of tech debt prompted a thorough review of the codebase to identify areas for improvement:</p>
<ul>
<li>Removal of unused assets and code snippets.</li>
<li>Refactoring of legacy code to improve readability and maintainability.</li>
<li>Elimination of support for outdated browsers.</li>
<li>Streamlining of build scripts to remove unnecessary generated files.</li>
</ul>

<p>I came across a tweet from Elon Musk that resonated deeply with me: &quot;Far better to delete code than add it.&quot; This philosophy encapsulates the essence of efficient software development. While striving for 100% optimized and performant code from day one may seem ideal, the reality is that codebases evolve over time, accumulating unnecessary complexities and redundancies.</p>
<p>Another quote I hold dear is, &quot;Always leave the code better than you found it,&quot; attributed to Ward Cunningham. This mindset drove me to embark on a journey of code refactoring and deletion, particularly in a legacy codebase spanning two decades.</p>
<p>Given that we were at the onset of a new release cycle, it presented the perfect opportunity to implement these changes.
In the process, I identified several areas ripe for improvement:</p>
<ul>
<li>Eliminating unused styles and assets meticulously, even if they were part of the codebase for years.</li>
<li>Letting go of support for outdated browsers, such as IE6, as their usage dwindled over time.</li>
<li>Since our project utilized the Dojo framework, it came with its own set of theme files. I painstakingly sifted through these files, pinpointing and eliminating any redundant styles that were no longer in use.</li>
<li>Streamlining build scripts to remove unnecessary auto-generated files, optimizing the build process.</li>
</ul>
<p>These actions required patience and thorough unit testing at every stage to ensure they didn&#x27;t impact existing functionality adversely. By adhering to these principles and embracing the challenge of improving legacy code, I not only enhanced the codebase&#x27;s quality but also cultivated a mindset of continuous improvement in software development.</p>
<p>We diligently conducted unit tests at every stage to ensure that our changes didn&#x27;t inadvertently impact any existing functionality.</p>
<p>In the end, this comprehensive cleanup effort not only improved the overall quality of our codebase but also positioned us for smoother development cycles in the future.</p>
